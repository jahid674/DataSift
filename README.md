We present DataSift,a data acquisition framework based on the idea of data valuationthat relies on partitioning and multi-armed bandits to determinethe most valuable data points to acquire. Over several iterations,DataSift selects a partition and randomly samples a batch of datapoints from the selected partition, evaluates the benefit of acquiringthe batch on model fairness, and updates the utility of partitionsdepending on the benefit. To further improve the effectiveness andefficiency of evaluating batches, we leverage influence functionsthat estimate the effect of acquiring a batch without retraining the ML model.
